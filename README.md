# Focus

**A deep-work enforcer for Windows.** Select the apps you need, pick a duration, and Focus locks you in — blocking every other window until your session is done.

## Why

Every existing focus tool either just plays a sound when your time is up or relies on you to honour your own rules. Focus takes a different approach: it physically pulls you back to your allowed windows the moment you drift. No willpower required.

- **tmux / window managers** — great for layout, zero enforcement
- **Pomodoro timers** — count down, then do nothing
- **Website blockers** — only cover the browser, ignore every other app

Focus treats the *entire desktop* as the boundary.

## Features

### Enforcement
- **Window blocking** — hooks into the Windows foreground-change event and forces focus back to your last allowed window within 50 ms of any disallowed switch
- **Backup poll enforcer** — a 250 ms poll loop catches apps that steal focus back during their own startup (Office, browsers) after the event-triggered refocus already ran
- **Process-level allow list** — every window of an allowed app (every tab, every dialog) is permitted; you pick by process, not individual window titles
- **Focus profiles** — save duration, allowed apps, and blocked websites as reusable named setups
- **Capture current workspace** — turn the apps currently open on your desktop into a saved profile
- **System tray** — the app hides to the tray so it never gets in your way; closing the window keeps the session running
- **Auto-focus on session start** — Focus brings its own window to the foreground the moment a session starts so you're never left on a blocked window

### Website Blocking
- **Hosts-file blocking** — injects `127.0.0.1` entries at session start and removes them cleanly at session end; works in every browser (requires admin, gracefully skipped if not elevated)
- **Chromium tab watcher** — monitors window title changes via a WinEvent hook and sends `Ctrl+W` to close any Chromium tab that navigates to a blocked domain; covers Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi
- **Persistent blocklist** — the domain list is stored in SQLite and survives app restarts; edit it at any time from the Session tab

### Timer & Overlay
- **Configurable sessions** — 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, or 60 minutes
- **Always-on-top overlay** — a compact floating timer that lives above every window, click-through by default so it never interrupts you
- **Drag mode** — unlock the overlay with `Ctrl+Shift+M` to reposition it, lock again to make it click-through
- **Silent goal completion** — when you hit your goal the overlay turns green and the session keeps running; no dialog, no interruption

### End-of-session
- **Motivational exit dialog** — if you try to quit *before* your goal, Focus shows three motivational prompts with a countdown before the exit button unlocks; each requires 5 seconds of reflection
- **Emergency pass** — one 2-minute pass per session can temporarily relax app and website blocking after you enter a reason
- **Frictionless exit after goal** — once your goal is reached, `Ctrl+Shift+J`, the End Session button, and tray → Exit all quit immediately with no dialog
- **Session history** — every session is saved to a local SQLite database; the History tab shows date, start/end times, duration, allowed windows, blocked app/site attempts, emergency pass use, and a running total

## Install

### Option 1 — Download the executable

1. Go to [Releases](../../releases) and download `Focus.exe`
2. Double-click to run — no Python required

### Option 2 — Run from source

**Requirements:** Python 3.12+, Windows 10/11

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Albertovh05/Focus.git
cd Focus
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Option 3 — Build the executable yourself

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
build.bat
# Outputs: dist/Focus.exe and dist/FocusSetup.exe
```

Installer builds require Inno Setup 6. For a faster developer build without the installer, run `build.bat fast`.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| End session (or trigger motivational dialog) | `Ctrl+Shift+J` |
| Toggle overlay drag mode | `Ctrl+Shift+M` |

**Threading model**

| Thread | Role |
|--------|------|
| Main | tkinter `mainloop`, all UI updates |
| `_hook_thread` (SessionManager) | Windows message loop for `EVENT_SYSTEM_FOREGROUND` WinEvent hook |
| `_timer_thread` | Fires `on_tick` every second |
| `_poll_thread` | 250 ms backup enforcer — catches apps that steal focus after the event-triggered refocus |
| `_hook_thread` (SiteBlocker) | Windows message loop for `EVENT_OBJECT_NAMECHANGE`; only active when blocked domains are set |
| pystray thread (daemon) | System tray icon message loop |
